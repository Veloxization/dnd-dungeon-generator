# Weekly Report 1
**Time spent:** 3.5 hours

Like usual for projects, most of the starting time goes into brainstorming ideas and planning. Most of my time has been spent looking into the course material and the different ways to generate mazes, especially with the special addition of rooms. Being quite new to Dungeons & Dragons myself, I also had to naturally investigate what a dungeon master would be looking for in a usual dungeon in their homebrew campaigns.

I have yet to write a single line of code as I like to first make completely sure that I know what I’m going to be working on at any time. Thanks to my research, however, I am more confident about figuring out what I will be working on in the coming weeks.

Research into maze generating algorithms was especially important to me as I have never worked with such algorithms before. I found out that there are multiple different maze generation algorithms, and that “perfect” and “imperfect” mazes exist, i.e., whether the mazes have any loops in them.

For this planning phase, the most difficult part was thinking about the details I want to include in this project while they still meet the requirements and will take enough time to be a reasonably sized project without being so oversized that it will be impossible to complete.

From next week, I will plan out the next parts of documentation to aid me in actually writing the code, possibly figuring out user stories for easier time allocation and development.
